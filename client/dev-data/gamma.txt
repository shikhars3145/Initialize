GAMMA: All-Season 100% Graphene Infused Heated Jacket

Introducing Gamma, the ultimate all-climate jacket. Gamma Jacket is a durable, lightweight, insulated jacket that doesn’t compromise function or fashion. Building on graphene's amazing properties, Gamma is your everyday jacket, your travel jacket, your activewear, and your going-out jacket. 

Back us today and discover why Gamma is the only layer you'll ever need whether you're hiking the Koʻolau ranges in Hawaii or skiing in the Swiss Alps or biking to work.

Whether you are hiking in the mountains or popping into town for a coffee, the heat-insulating design will warm you up in a matter of seconds. Gamma is the only jacket you’ll need all year round, all around the globe.

Graphene is what makes Gamma unlike any other activewear. Graphene is a nano-lattice - just one atom thick, yet it’s stronger than diamond. Known as “supreme graphene” for its long list of properties and benefits, graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and most flexible known material.

By infusing a graphene layer into the Gamma Jacket, we were able to create a new kind of outerwear. Gamma functions as a winter jacket, a cool-weather jacket, a windbreaker, a rain jacket, and activewear all at once.
