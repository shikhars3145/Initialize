DIY Oxygen Concentrator Kit

As the acute shortage of medical oxygen leaves hospitals across the country gasping, we are trying to put together a kit that can help deliver the live-saving gas for critical patients at home or hospitals.

We have fabricated a crude prototype of a do-it-yourself oxygen kit that can be used to generate oxygen sufficient for a patient in home care. The kit uses materials that can be bought off the shelf.

Producing oxygen through electrolysis is part of high school science. There are plenty of videos available on YouTube that explain how to do this. Only thing is that this has to be done using readily available materials and at a cost that is not very high.

We plan on creating a ready to use kit so that even people with no scientific and technical knowledge can use it.
