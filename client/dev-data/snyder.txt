#Release The Snyder Cut

On Friday, November 17th, 2017 our collective hearts sank with the realization that justice league, a film that many of us had been waiting our whole lives for, was a mere shell of what it should have been. What had been suspected by many, was finally understood by all… this was no Zack Snyder film.


The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.


In spite of this major blow, the community rallied behind initiatives to make our desire for justice heard. Justice for us as loyal customers who had been tricked; justice for the characters that we love and were so mistreated; justice for the cast and crew who saw all their hard work left on the cutting room floor; and most of all, justice for Zack Snyder and his family.


We must be willing to get rid of the life we’ve planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.


In mid 2018 we became organized, realizing that we could not expect change to just happen for us, but that we had to make it happen ourselves. We sent our tweets, we wrote our letters, we made our phone calls, we showed our faces, we marched at comic conventions, flew banners in the sky and in arenas, and lit up times square. All the while raising funds in honor of zack’s late daughter autumn, for suicide awareness and prevention, and feeding the hungry during the holidays.


Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls.


Over a two year period, we faced opposition from formidable adversaries, but with passion and compassion, we changed Hollywood forever. Once maligned for daring to celebrate zack’s films, we now stand proudly in front of the human race waiting for others to join us in the sun.
